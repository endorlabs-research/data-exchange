# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Endor Labs Quick Scan with custom SARIF filter
### README ####
## This is an example GitHub Actions workflow that uses the JSON findings output
## from the Endor LAbs GitHub Action to generate a customized SARIF file
##
## Endor Labs natively supports SARIF output, but this is an example of producing
## it yourself so that you can customize the contents, decide what goes into the
## SARIF output, etc.
##
## This example assumes you've set up GitHub Actions OIDC auth connetion to your
## Endor Labs tenant and set a repository or org variable named ENDOR_NAMESPACE
## so that it contains your tenant name

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    permissions: 
      issues: write            # required for SARIF upload (also requires public repo or GHAS subscription)
      pull-requests: write     # required for PR comments
      security-events: write   # required for SARIF upload
      contents: read           # required to access repository data from this action
      id-token: write          # required for OIDC auth to Endor Labs
      actions: read            
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
